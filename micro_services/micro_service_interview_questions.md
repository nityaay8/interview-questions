## hystrix
     How does hystrix Circuit Breaker work?
    
    The circuit breaker calculates when to open and close the circuit and what to do in case of a failure. Hystrix watches for failures on 
    those annotated  methods, and opens the circuit so that subsequent calls will automatically fail.i.e. when circuit is open, Hystrix redirects calls to the fallback method.
