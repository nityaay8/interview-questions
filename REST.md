## what is REST
Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that describes a uniform interface between physically separate components, often across the Internet in a Client-Server architecture. REST defines four interface constraints:

1. Identification of resources
2. Manipulation of resources
3. Self-descriptive messages and
4. hypermedia as the engine of application state[1]
