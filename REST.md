## what is REST
Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that describes a uniform interface between physically separate components, often across the Internet in a Client-Server architecture. REST defines four interface constraints:

Identification of resources
Manipulation of resources
Self-descriptive messages and
hypermedia as the engine of application state[1]
